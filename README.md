URL shortener client API library for node.js
============================================

[shorturl](https://github.com/jdub/node-shorturl) is a simple, asynchronous client library for common URL shortener services. It currently supports: arseh.at, bit.ly, goo.gl, is.gd, v.gd and string substitution links (with %@).

If you [need to go deeper](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/), try the more complete client libraries for individual services such as [node-bitly](https://github.com/tanepiper/node-bitly) or [node-googl](https://github.com/ukstv/node-googl).
